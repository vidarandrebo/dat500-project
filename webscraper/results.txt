“Today, after nearly 25 years here, I’ve decided to step back from my role as the head of YouTube and start a new chapter focused on my family, health, and personal projects I’m passionate about,” she said.
Wojcicki joined YouTube as the CEO nine years ago, in 2014.
She will continue working with YouTube teams, coaching members and meeting with creators, she added.
Wojcicki said she agreed with Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai to, in the longer term, take on an advisory role across Google and Alphabet. “This will allow me to call on my different experiences over the years to offer counsel and guidance across Google and the portfolio of Alphabet companies,” she wrote.
“The time is right for me, and I feel able to do this because we have an incredible leadership team in place at YouTube,” she noted. “When I joined YouTube nine years ago, one of my first priorities was bringing in an incredible leadership team.”
She said she spent nearly 15 years of her career working with Mohan “first when he came over to Google with the DoubleClick acquisition in 2007 and as his role grew to become SVP of Display and Video Ads.”

Producer prices for final demand in the US increased 0.7% month-over-month in January of 2023, the most in seven months and higher than market forecasts of 0.4%. Goods prices jumped 1.2%, also the largest increase since rising 2.1% in June 2022, led by a 6.2% surge in gasoline cost. The indexes for residential natural gas, diesel fuel, jet fuel, soft drinks, and motor vehicles also moved higher. Conversely, prices for fresh and dry vegetables decreased 33.5%. The indexes for residual fuels and for basic organic chemicals also declined. Meanwhile, services cost edged 0.4% higher, mainly hospital outpatient care (1.4%). The indexes for automobiles and automobile parts retailing; health, beauty, and optical goods retailing; portfolio management; chemicals and allied products wholesaling; and airline passenger services also moved higher. In contrast, margins for fuels and lubricants retailing fell 17.5%. source: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics

TITLE: Charlie Munger says BYD is so far ahead of Tesla in China it’s almost ridiculous
.t3_113axql._2FCtq-QzlfuN-SwVMUZMM3 { --postTitle-VisitedLinkColor: #afccfb; --postTitleLink-VisitedLinkColor: #afccfb; --postBodyLink-VisitedLinkColor: #989898; }
CONTENT:
https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/15/charlie-munger-says-byd-is-far-ahead-of-tesla-in-china.html
Charlie Munger said Wednesday that Tesla pales in comparison to BYD in China, calling the Chinese electric vehicle maker his favorite stock ever.
“I have never helped do anything at Berkshire [Hathaway] that was as good as BYD and I only did it once,” the 99-year-old investor said at the Daily Journal’s virtual annual meeting Wednesday. Berkshire initial investment is now “worth about $8 billion or maybe $9 [billion]. That’s a pretty good rate of return,” said Warren Buffett’s longtime investment partner.
BYD has been a lucrative bet for Berkshire , which first bought about 220 million shares in September 2008. The stock has jumped more than 600% in the past 10 years amid the massive growth in electric vehicles. Berkshire has actually been trimming its BYD stake in the past year as the stock has become increasingly pricey.
“At the current price of BYD stock, little BYD is worth more than the entire Mercedes corporation. It’s not a cheap stock, but on the other hand, it’s a very remarkable company,” Munger said.
Munger, Berkshire’s vice chairman and a Daily Journal board member, credited Li Lu, founder of Seattle-based asset manager Himalaya Capital, for introducing him to BYD. Munger also said BYD CEO Wang Chuanfu is unusual, calling him a genius and a workaholic.
Asked if he would prefer Tesla or BYD as an investment, Munger said the answer is easy.
“Tesla last year reduced its prices in China twice. BYD increased its prices. We are direct competitors. BYD is so much ahead of Tesla in China ... it’s almost ridiculous,” Munger said.
BYD recently said it expects record adjusted annual profit for 2022 of 16.3 billion yuan ($2.4 billion), about 1,200% above 2021.
“BYD last year made more than $2 billion after taxes in the auto business in China. It’s incredible what’s happened,” Munger said. “If you count all the manufacturing space they have in China to make cars, it would amount to a big percentage of the Manhattan island, and nobody had ever heard of them a few years ago.”
The longtime investor called Tesla CEO Elon Musk talented — and peculiar. He previously said what Musk achieved in the car business was a “minor miracle.”
“I don’t buy him, and I don’t short him,” Munger said Wednesday.

Unemployment is still lowest in last 50 years. Economy is so strong its nearly impossible for stocks to test bottom again especially considering last year at one point we went almost 30% down..
Earnings are still quite decent, people spending like crazy, inflation went down a lot for last few months. Even JPOW said Jan a bit hotter inflation was expected.

If someone had $100k just sitting in a bank account, how would you advise them to let that money work for them considering they have very limited knowledge of investing? -get a financial planner or advisor of some sort? -use the money to purchase dividends instead of sitting in the bank account?
or would you use it for the bills treasuries and such for the easy 4-6%?
Or invest in real estate? The money was originally going to be used to buy property at auction, but it's ended up just sitting. Auctions have been terrible since the pandemic.

CONTENT:
So DDOG reported earnings this morning. On initial report stock dropped 10% on what I assume was weak guidance(Forecasting Q1'23 would be flat to Q4'22). And lower than expected guidance for FY 2023. The problem is, they always do this. I started researching this after it dropped 10%, it seems to have rebounded a fair bit as of typing this post, but wanted to share results anyway.


Columns:
Revenue: (reported from ER)


Guidance: from previous quarter ER (I took the midpoint of their range. The ranges are small though, mostly 2-5 Million)


AS of: is the date the guidance for that quarter was given(from previous ER; the language is literally 'Guidance as of XXXX date')


% Quarter Completed: Reflects how much of the quarter was done by the as of date




ER Quarter
Revenue (Actual)
Guidance (From PrevQ)

Q4'22

447
11/3/22
65%


And for a comparison as to how bad/consistent their guidance is off


Forecasted QoQ is just guidance/actuals; both data points are from the same ER(so Q2'22 guidance/Q1'21 actuals from same ER)




ER Quarter
Actual QoQ Growth
Forecasted QoQ Growth
Miss %
Q2'21

4%
-7.3%
Q3'22
7%
1%
-6.9%
Q4'22
8%
2%
-5.6%




My questions is, is there a reason for this? With so much stock swings at ER being because of guidance, why would a company consistently forecast below. Is it incompetence on the part of the team doing the forecasting? Are they trying to keep their share price low to hamper stock options among employees in the firm? Especially since they are a growth stock. Is it simply, lower guidance = easier to beat?


They are listing these guidance with the quarters over half done.

Good morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to Thursday! Here are your pre-market stock movers & news on this Thursday, February the 16th, 2023-
Dow futures slide 150 points after another hot inflation report: Live updates
Stock futures fell Thursday as traders digest another hot inflation report along with jobless claims showing the economy is holding up amid the Federal Reserve’s rate hikes.
Futures linked to the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 172 points, or 0.49%. S&P 500 futures dipped 0.71% and Nasdaq-100 futures fell 0.85%. Earnings beats sent some shares higher - Roku surged 12% in premarket trading, Cisco added more than 3% and Hasbro ticked 1% higher.
Stocks closed slightly higher Wednesday even after a stronger-than-expected January retail sales report suggested the Federal Reserve may have further to go in its efforts to tame inflation. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 38.78 points, or 0.11%, and the S&P 500 climbed 0.28%. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite notched its third straight day of gains, rising 0.92%.
For some market observers, that suggested stocks could have more room to run from here — even after their strong start to the year.
“It looks like this rally does have some legs, and you can’t fight some of the tape right now,” Victoria Greene, chief investment officer at G Squared Private Wealth, said Wednesday on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime.”
“The Fed is saying that they’re going to be hawkish, but the technicals are saying this rally is in, and I really don’t think we’re going to retest those October lows anymore, because we’ve hit some really important technical supports,” Greene said.
Wall Street is expecting further economic insight from a slew of reports Thursday. For starters, another inflation gauge will be out in the morning, the January producer price index. Dow Jones estimates are calling for a rise of 0.4%, compared to December’s decline of 0.5%.
Weekly jobless claims data, as well as January’s housing starts report, are also due Thursday.

Sorry if this question has been asked before, I tried searching for an answer but maybe I am not phrasing it the best that I can. So say I had 500k invested into an index fund and it was growing at 7% annually. If I take 3.5% of my earnings would I be paying taxes on the full gain of $35000 or only the amount I took out which is $17500? And if the former is the case how would it work if I'm constantly doing this every month/year?

Hey reddit, I'm posting this here in hopes someone could point me in the right direction, and hopefully I'm not crazy.
My mom and dad are divorced (in 2013), but during the time of 1998/1999 she saved up the money to buy $6000 in Amazon stocks. I know that there was a depreciation in stocks, so when questioned my father claimed that "we lost it all", but I know that Amazon's stocks quickly appreciated and that people made a lot of money if they had stuck with them during those years, and now Amazon is a multi-million dollar company. Trouble is, my mom doesn't have access to the joint bank account where she made the wire transfer, but she swears she made the purchase. How should she go about looking into this? I don't fully trust my father, since he's also an alcoholic and quite a manipulative person. However, he's never been a stock expert either, and we barely have contact.. am I crazy for thinking there's something to this?

E-commerce has not been profitable for years and perhaps won’t be
Companies are trying to reduce AWS costs across the globe
Their experimental products like Alexa services are a flop
They have hands in too many jars and don’t know what to do with most of those.
Why would anyone still choose to invest in AMZN?

Sales at retailers rose far more than expected in January as consumers persevered despite rising inflation pressures.
Advance retail sales for the month increased 3%, compared to expectations for a rise of 1.9%, the Commerce Department reported Wednesday. Excluding autos, sales increased 2.3%, according to the report, which is not adjusted for inflation. The ex-autos estimate was for a gain of 0.9%.

I suppose the rise of the PPI as well as the speech of Fed Mester shall mean more FED hikes and therefore result in fall of the stocks market, as well as the speech
But the stocks market is not falling down. Maybe one of the reasons why the stock market is not falling is because the 2year yield has not risen today on this news? If that is the case, than why does the 2 year yield dos not rise on this bad news today?

TITLE: Roblox stock up 24% after fourth-quarter earnings report beats estimates

Shares of Roblox popped 24% Wednesday after the company reported fourth-quarter earnings that beat analysts’ expectations on top and bottom lines.
Here’s how the company did:
Loss per share: 48 cent loss vs. 52 cent loss per share expected, according to a Refinitiv survey of analysts
Revenue (bookings): $899.4 million vs. $881.4 million expected, according to Refinitiv
The revenue figure is what Roblox calls bookings, which include sales recognized during the quarter and deferred revenue. Bookings rose by 17% year over year. The company generates revenue from sales of its virtual currency called Robux, which players use to dress up their avatars and buy other premium features in the games.
Roblox reported 58.8 million average daily active users, up 19% from a year earlier. Users spent more than 12.8 billion hours engaged in Roblox during the fourth quarter, up 18% year over year.
The company said average bookings per daily active user was $15.29, down 2% year over year.
Roblox saw bookings swell more than 200% during the pandemic when kids were spending more time on their screens while stuck at home. The stock was blazing hot in 2021, after Roblox’s direct listing in March. Its market cap neared $80 billion before peaking in November 2021.

Hi all. A few questions about stock gain and taxes. I had considerable gains in 2020-2021 ($500K) and paid the taxes I owed. In 2022, my loss was around $200 K, and my wife had gains of $70K in 2022 (lol). We file our taxes as married jointly. My questions are:
Will my loss offset her gains, so we don't have to pay any taxes on her gains?
What happens next year? - if there is a net profit of 100K next year, can I use the remaining losses to offset the gains of 100K?
Please let me know. Thanks a lot.

TITLE: Nvidia: Don't Buy The AI Hype Pre-Earnings

After reaching a valuation of more than $800 billion in late 2021, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares fell sharply -- intermittently by as 70% from the all-time high. With that frame of reference, Nvidia's fundamentals were pressured by a slowdown in gaming, crypto-mining and the broader personal computer market. However, on the backdrop of the ChatGPT tailwind, NVDA stock has started to rebound aggressively, reflecting investor optimism about the potential of generative AI technology.
While I acknowledge the tailwind that Nvidia is likely to see from AI computing, I also argue that the thesis remains speculative, given the early stages of the technology. Moreover, investors should consider that the market is already pricing lots of optimism--with NVDA shares valued at a FWD EV/EBIT of close to x60.
Nvidia is scheduled to report Q4 2022 earnings on February 22nd, and I assign a 'Hold' rating pre-announcement.
